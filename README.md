The input data from human is publicly available at http://www.humanconnectome.org/data.  
The input data from monkey is publicly available at http://neurotycho.org.  
The Connectome Workbench software is used to display the human brain surface. The software is open source and freely available at http://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench.  
The code files included:
cal_corr_direction_human.m: the script to project human input data onto a direction and calculate time-position correlation within each segment.  
cal_corr_direction_monkey.m: the script to project monkey input data onto a direction and calcualte time-position correlation within each segment.
cal_pd.m: the script to calculate the principal delay profile.
